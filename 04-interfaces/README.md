# Assignment 04

## Part I: code review of previous assignment

Using the [solution]) and the [technical note]() for the previous assignment, conduct a code review for your **improved DynamicArray** program. In your review:

* describe any red, yellow, or green level issues with your code. For red and yellow issues, discuss what led to them;
* suggest how the code could be improved;
* reflect if the quality of your code is related to time management and how to mitigate things.
* propose how Leo's code can be improved.

Your review must exude professionalism: few (ideally no) typos, and nicely organized. You may produce it as a PDF file to attach to Sakai, or as plain text typed straight in the Sakai textbox. It may be a good idea if you used an editor to compose your review, then past the text in Sakai to avoid loss of data.

## Part II: implementing interfaces

## Reading material

Our work for far is based on chapters 3, 4, 7, and 8 of the textbook used in COMP 170. The book is *not* required however for COMP 271. Instead, you may review the following material. And if you require additional reading resources, please let me know.

* [Interfaces tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html)  from the Java documentation project.

* [Classes and Objects tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/index.html) from the Java documentation project. Skip the material for nested classes and enum(eration)s for now.

* [Java in a Nutshell](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/java-in-a/9781098130992/), avaiable from the O'Reilly platform at no cost when you use your LUC email to login.
